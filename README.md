#  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This mini project predicts house prices based on features such as **area** and **number of bedrooms** using a **Linear Regression model** built with Python and Scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how **machine learning** can be applied to solve real-world problems like property price estimation.  
By training a linear regression model on a small dataset, the system can estimate prices for new houses accurately.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Gather dataset containing area, bedrooms, and price.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean data and prepare for training.  
3. **Model Training** – Train a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.  
4. **Prediction** – Use the trained model to predict prices for new data.  
5. **Evaluation** – Evaluate accuracy using R² Score and Mean Squared Error.
